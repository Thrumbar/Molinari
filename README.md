## Description

Molinari was made to aid the player in processing various items throughout the game.  
As an example; when you'd want to mill herbs, you would normally cast [Milling](https://wowhead.com/spell=51005) and then click the item in your bags.  
With Molinari, you simply hold down the `Alt` key and click the item directly.

The following spells/processes are supported:

- [Milling](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=51005)
  - [Draenic Mortar](https://www.wowhead.com/item=114942)
- [Prospecting](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=31252)
- [Disenchanting](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=13262)

  - [Skeleton Pinkie](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=312890) (Mechagnome racial)
  - [Kevin's Keyring](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=323427) (Necrolord soulbind ability)
