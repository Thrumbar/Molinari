# Molinari

This is an addon for the popular MMORPG "World of Warcraft".  
It can be downloaded at [Curse](//mods.curse.com/addons/wow/molinari) or at [WoWInterface](//wowinterface.com/downloads/info13188).

## Description

Molinari was made to aid the player in processing various items throughout the game.  
As an example; when you'd want to mill herbs, you would normally cast [Milling](//wowhead.com/spell=51005) and then click the item in your bags.  
With Molinari, you simply hold down the `Alt` key and click the item directly.

The following spells/processes are supported:

- [Milling](//wowhead.com/spell=51005) & [Draenic Mortar](//wowhead.com/item=114942)
- [Prospecting](//wowhead.com/spell=31252)
- [Disenchanting](//wowhead.com/spell=13262)
- [Lockpicking](//wowhead.com/spell=1804) & [skeleton keys](//wowhead.com/items?filter=na=key;cr=86;crs=2)

In addition, Molinari also works for lockpicking in the trade window.
